# Red Blue Graph problem solver

The problem is the following:

In a directed graph, each node is colored either red or blue. Furthermore, vertices are also colored red or blue.

When a node is deleted, its adjacent nodes are colored the same color than the vertice which made the link with the node.

Can we delete an uninterrupted sequence of k nodes with all the same color ?
